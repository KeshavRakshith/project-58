          <p>I love Pokemon anime because it has more adventues.It also has great Pokemon battles.In that way Ash Ketchum the main protaganist of Pokemon anime.I love him too.The main thing is he travells and adventures with his friends all around the world and his dream is to become a Pokemon master.In the pokemon league all the participantes have to battle with their Pokemon.They have to win 8 badges to participate in the league which happens for three years once in all region of Pokemon.He travelled 8 regions and 9 th reagion is on going.The reagions are Kanto,Jhoto,Orange Islands,Hoean,Sinnoh,Unova,Kalos,Alola and Galar ongoing.He participated in all the leagus of the 8 reagion.His starter Pokemon is Pikachu.His only Pokemon which travells with him from the first.There are high teck deivice in pokemon anime known as Pokedex and Pokeball.When a Pokemon trainer encounters a pokemon they will check what pokemon is it with thier pokedex and they have to fight to that pokemon with their starter Pokemon and after winning the battle trainers have to throw the pokeball on the pokemon which they have defeted.If they suceed cathing the pokemon the pokemon will go inside the pokeball.A trainer can have only 6 pokemons at a time If they caught more than 6 pokemon the pokemon will transfer to the proffecor's lab.A trainer will get their starter pokemon from the proffecor.There will be one Pokemon proffecor in one region.There will be 3 starter pokemon in a proffecor's lab.The trainers have to choose the starter pokemon from the proffecor.The starter pokemon will be of three types Fire,Water and grass.There will be different starters in differet region.There are 18 types of pokemon.</p>
